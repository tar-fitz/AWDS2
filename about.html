                <p>
                    My name is Tarek Miah and I'm a Fitzgerald High School student. Since freshman year, I started to like coding when I took it. I am 17 years old and will graduate in 2022. I play with the school team and a travel club team. My favorite sport is soccer.

                    At one point, Freshman year web design was confusing, but I began to get better at it. I began to enjoy it and became innovative with it. My instructor offered me to take other coding classes I said yes, but I couldn't take it unforutually. Here I am in junior year taking advanced web and I forgot a few things, but that doesn't stop me from getting creative with the codes.

                    My success in web design is that I learn something new every time I get creative. Web design was challenging at the beginning of this year, but I managed to work hard on myself and relearn everything. I'm also a soccer player, so some accomplishments are that I enjoyed working hard on myself and making myself recover while I was injured. I even play sometimes when I'm injured to show my teammates that I care as a captain.
